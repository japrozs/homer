# Homer
Homer is a general-use, imperative scripting language which is focused on simplicity and ease of usability.

# Getting Started
Homer files end with a `.hm` extension. To get started, create a new file called `hello.hm` extension and type the following peice of code inside the file :
```python
print "Hello World";
```

Then, go to your terminal, navigate to the directory where you stored the file and type in the following command:
```bash
$ homer hello.hm
```
If you see the following code output, then congratulations on writing your first peice of Homer code.
```bash
Hello World
```
